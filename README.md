# Game of Life - TDD

Finished in approx. 2 hours.

All logic is tested. Only the ASCII output method is not, was only built to visualize the engine.

Everything is ugly. No refactorings. First try of MRI 1.9.3-p0.

Nothing special. Nothing important. Just fun.

## Why?

Game of Life is fun. Read more: [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

TDD of this tiny code was inspired by this [Screencast: Coding Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in Ruby the TDD Way with RSpec](http://www.rubyinside.com/screencast-coding-conways-game-of-life-in-ruby-the-tdd-way-with-rspec-5564.html).

I thought he did it in a too complex way, for a simple *GOL* we only need to know the state changes in every tick, so the cell as an object was completely overdosed IMHO.

## Future?

Maybe I give it a GUI, maybe not. Maybe I build some pattern tests, maybe not. Maybe I'll refactor, maybe not.

Maybe nothing.

## Why WTF?

We should share code, publicly. Contribute code. Share knowledge, experience and love!

## Free and open source

Take it, learn from it, make anything else with it.

Don't blame me.
