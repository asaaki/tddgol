# Game of Life - TDD

Finished in approx. 2h

All logic is tested. Only the ASCII output method is not, was only built to visualize the engine.

Everything is ugly. No refactorings. First try of MRI 1.9.3-p0.

Nothing special. Nothing important. Just fun.

## Why?

We should share code, publicly. Contribute code. Share knowledge, experience and love!
